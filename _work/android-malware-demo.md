This project was an assignment in Computer Security that aims to show how a simple app could be infected with malware.

The main purpose of this program is to become familiar with the dangers of malware on mobile devices. Malware can come in many forms including; computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, and adware to name a few. The above application will demonstrate how an Android application that performs a useful function could contain hidden malicious software.

The project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nsalerni/Android-SMS-Listener). (Note: The above application is intended to be a learning tool that can be used to teach us how to protect devices against this type of malware)
