Vision is an internal application I helped design for [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com). Employees can read updates from management and other craftsmen, access internal applications and edit their profile.

Since this is an internal company project, I had to work within the [8th Light Syleguide](http://8thlight.com/styleguide) while still giving the app its own character.

A night sky full of stars inspired the background patternâ€“dreams and goals for the future. Custom icons add personality and make the navigation items more readable. A simple menu icon toggles expansion of the navigation items on mobile screens.

This application was built with [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com).
