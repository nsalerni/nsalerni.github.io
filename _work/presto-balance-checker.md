In this [three part workshop](http://www.adamkaplan.me/css-workshop), [Stephanie Briones](http://www.stephaniebriones.com) and I [covered CSS best practices](https://github.com/aekaplan/css-workshop/blob/gh-pages/README.md) including code organization, reusability and more advanced techniques.

I had the opportunity to give this workshop during an internal [8th Light](https://8thlight.com) event and for the front-end developers at [NCSA](http://www.ncsasports.org).

I felt that a clear hiearchy and accessible code examples were a priority for this project. I chose a simple navigation with links to each day of the workshop and added the ability to copy code examples to the user's clipboard with a simple click.

In terms of technology, I built this project mobile-first with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
